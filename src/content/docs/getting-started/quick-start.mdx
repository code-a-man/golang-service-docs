### Structure

This project inherits the [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) structure but includes its own interpretation.


### Directories

- The `pkg` directory contains packages for project modules. The absence of a direct `internal` folder helps us maintain a mentally isolated modular structure.
- The `deployment` directory contains local and remote infrastructure configuration files, such as `compose.yml`.
- The `cmd` directory contains the entrypoint for the project binaries.

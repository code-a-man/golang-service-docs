- 1️⃣ Ensure that `golang` tools are _properly_ installed on your machine

  ```bash
  $ go version
  go version go0.0.0 os/arch64

  $ go env GOPATH
  ~/go/0.0.0/packages
  ```

  **Important rules:**
  - `GOPATH` envvar must be set to output of `go env GOPATH`
  - `$GOPATH/bin` must be included to your `PATH` envvar

  So, your `~/.zprofile` should include something like this:

  ```
  export GOPATH="$(go env GOPATH)"
  export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
  ```


- 2️⃣ Install prerequisites
  - Install and enable [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

  - Install [govulncheck](https://go.googlesource.com/vuln)
  - Install [gcov2lcov](https://github.com/jandelgado/gcov2lcov?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

- 3️⃣ (Optional) Ensure that you can access private dependencies

  You need to get a Personal Access Token from your GitHub account in order to
  download private dependencies.

  To get these, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new
  token with the `read:packages` scope.

  Then, you need to create or edit the `.netrc` file in your home directory with
  the following content:

  ```
  machine github.com login <your-github-username> password <your-github-access-token>
  ```


- 4️⃣ Download required modules for the project

  ```bash
  $ make dep
  ```


- 5️⃣ (Optional) Check installation via pre-commit scripts

  ```bash
  $ pre-commit run --all-files
  ```
